<Info>
  Cybrance.nl makes it easy to develop, preview, and deploy Discord bots. Use
  our dashboard and CLI tools to manage your bots efficiently.
</Info>

Follow these steps to develop and preview your Discord bot before deploying:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Cybrance CLI">

```bash
npm i -g cybrance-cli
```

</Step>

<Step title="Preview your bot locally">

Navigate to your bot directory and run:

```bash
cybrance preview
```

Your bot will run locally, and you can test its features before deploying.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Custom ports

By default, Cybrance uses port 3000 for local previews. You can customize the port with the `--port` flag:

```bash
cybrance preview --port 3333
```

If the port is in use, Cybrance will automatically select the next available port.

## CLI Updates

Keep your CLI up to date for the latest features:

```bash
npm update -g cybrance-cli
```

## Validating bot configuration

Check your bot's configuration and environment variables:

```bash
cybrance validate
```

## Deployment

Deploy your bot to Cybrance.nl with a single command:

```bash
cybrance deploy
```

Monitor deployment status and logs in your [dashboard](https://cybrance.nl/dashboard).
