# How to Restart Your Bot After Push

Keep your bot up to date by using GitHub Actions to restart it after every push.

**Steps:**

1. Set up the [Autodeploy workflow](/blog/autodeploy)
2. Add your Cytric API key and server ID as secrets/variables
3. Every push to `main` will trigger a restart and update

**Tip:** See the [Autodeploy guide](/blog/autodeploy) for details and example workflow.
