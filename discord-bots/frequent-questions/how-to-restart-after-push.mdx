# How to Restart Your Bot After Push

Use GitHub Actions to automatically restart your bot on Cybrance after each push:

- Set up the [Autodeploy workflow](../../blog/autodeploy.mdx)
- Add your Cybrance API key and server ID as secrets/variables
- Every push to `main` will trigger a restart and update

See the [Autodeploy guide](../../blog/autodeploy.mdx) for details.
