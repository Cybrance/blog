# How to Enable Privileged Intents

Privileged intents are required for bots that need access to member, presence, or message data.

**Steps:**

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Select your bot application.
3. Under the **Bot** tab, enable the required privileged intents (e.g., Presence, Server Members).
4. Save changes and restart your bot.

**Tip:** Without privileged intents, your bot may not receive certain events.
